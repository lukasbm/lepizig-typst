  This file demonstrates the usage of the FAU theme for typst.

  You can simply start by importing the theme for your institution (RW, Phil, Med,
  Tech, Nat, FAU) and then use the `#setup-theme` function to set it up:

  ```typst
    #import "@preview/polylux:0.4.0": *
    #import "../fau-typst.typ": nat-theme, main
    #import nat-theme: *

    #show: main.setup-theme.with(
      short-author: "Lukas Böhm",
      short-title: "Test Document",
      short-date: datetime.today(),
      short-organization: "Lab1",
    )
    ```

#slide(
  title: "Sections",
  subtitle: "And how to use them",
)[
  Sections in slides are always tricky to handle.

  In this template level 1 headings defined like: `= Heading of level 1` are
  disabled. Instead you use `#section-slide("Title")`. This will register the
  section and generate an overview slide with the current section highlighted.

  The other heading levels should work as intended.

  = Should not show!
  == Should show second level heading
  === and 3rd level as well

  The presentation can be exported to pdf and used with #link("https://pdfpc.github.io/")[pdfpc] to
  present it. Pdfpc is a presenter console with multi-monitor support, allowing
  you to have presenter specific tools like laser-pointer, notes and a timer on a
  second screen.

  By using the special `#pdfpc.speaker-note(body)` function from polylux you can
  add notes to your slides that will only be visible to the presenter.
  #pdfpc.speaker-note("This is a note only the speaker will see")

  The body can be regular text as well as raw Markdown.

  Take a look at the #link(
    "https://andreaskroepelin.github.io/polylux/book/external/pdfpc.html",
  )[polylux documentation] for more information.
